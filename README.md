This project is from CS336 during the Spring 2024 semester, for which we (Matteus Coste, Diego Damian, Daniel Khrapko, and Steven Zamora) implemented a relational database system that supports the operations of an online auction system.
This system is intended to support a company, named BuyMe, that lets users buy and sell items in an online auction.
